---- Cython with heap allocated arrays ----

This report contains the running time for the pure Python
implementation, the Numpy implementation and the Cython
implementation. The times are recorded using the module
time in the script profile_mandelbrot.py.

All implementations were tested against a region in the
complex plane [xmin=-3, xmax=3], [ymin=-3, ymax=3] with
Nx = Ny = 1000 and max_escape_time=1000 with the
divergence_criteria=2. The average times are calculated
five rounds for each implementation.

The normalized running times are compared to the
average Python runtime.

---- ********************************* ----

Average running time for the three implementations.
Running time for Python: 27.17 sec
Running time for Numpy: 21.04 sec
Running time for Cython: 0.602 sec

Normalized running times
Python: 1.0
Numpy:  0.7747
Cython: 0.02216
